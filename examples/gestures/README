This is a simple example demo for the gesture recognition code.
It allows you record gestures, and then have them recognised.

Future versions will allow you to save gesture templates to
disk, but this is not implemented yet.


== REQUIREMENTS ==

libwcl (built with at least gestures enabled)
qt4-dev


== BUILDING ==
qmake
make


== RUNNING ==
./gestures

1. Enter a name for the gesture to record
2. hit record
3. create the gesture
4. repeat steps 1-3 to save several gestures
5. gesturing on the canvas will have the gesture recognised
