This CVS module contains libwcl, a library that has been 
developed to aid in the building of applications or other libraries.


* BUILDING
********************

In order to build and install libwcl do:

sh autogen.sh
./configure --help
# Work out what options you would like
./configure --enable-option1 --enable-option2
make
make install

Note that the templates currently crash clang++


* Developing 
********************

If you want to add code to LibWCL, then great! However, there are a few things
you need to do before submitting code:

1. Have a long hard think about whether you want to put your code under the BSD
   license. LibWCL is only really distributed within the lab, so it's not like
   you'll be giving away your code to evil corporations.

2. Make sure Git knows your name and email address BEFORE you make any commits.

      git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
      git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

3. Edit AUTHORS and add your name and email address, signifying that you agree
   to put your code under the BSD license. Commit and push this file when you
   have done so.

4. If you add any new files, ensure they have the BSD header in them. You can
   copy/paste from an existing file.


* DOCUMENTATION
********************

Most of the code is documented with Doxygen comments. There is a doxygen config file
preconfigured to generate nice html documentation. Generating the doc is easy:

doxygen libwcl.dox

We also have a bug tracker:

http://wcl.ml.unisa.edu.au/redmine

* EXAMPLES
********************

To build examples you will need the following extra libraries:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev freeglut3-dev libqt4-dev

Following this, you can enable the examples during configure:

./configure --enable-examples
make
